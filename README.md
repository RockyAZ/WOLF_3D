# WOLF_3D
3D graphic representation of game wolf3d using C laguage and sdl graphic library using only pixel by pixel drawing.
Project was written according to original technology of Wolfenstein named <Raycasting>, 
but with adding some features like ability to look up and down.
Do not pay attention to code style(this because of my school coding style patterns).
